# Forecasting Unit Sales on Amazon

This project involves forecasting the number of units sold for various items listed by a well-known brand on Amazon. The dataset includes historical sales data, which is used to build predictive models to forecast future sales.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the number of units sold for various products on specific dates. The predictions are evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Data Description

The dataset contains sales data with the following columns:

- **date**: The date on which the sales data was recorded (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Item Id**: A unique identifier for each item.
- **Item Name**: The name of the item.
- **anarix_id**: An internal identifier for the item.
- **ad_spend**: The amount of money spent on advertising for the item.
- **units**: The number of units sold (target variable).
- **orderedrevenueamount**: The total revenue generated from the units sold.
- **unit_price**: The price per unit of the item.

### Files

- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing historical sales data.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset where the target variable (`units`) needs to be predicted.
- **sample_submission.csv**: Sample submission file for reference.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forecasting-unit-sales.git
cd forecasting-unit-sales
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the data using the provided scripts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the forecasting model on the historical sales data.
3. **Prediction**: Generate predictions on the test set.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using MSE.

To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Modeling Approach

- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the data distribution, trends, and seasonality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating time-based features, lag features, and interaction terms.
- **Model Selection**: Trying out different models such as ARIMA, Random Forest, or XGBoost for forecasting.
- **Cross-Validation**: Using time series cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy.

## Evaluation

The primary evaluation metric used in this project is Mean Squared Error (MSE). The model's performance is assessed based on how well it minimizes this error on the validation set and test set.

## Results

The final model achieves an MSE of **X.XX** on the test set. The results are visualized in the form of time series plots and error analysis.
